# Week 1 Code Challenges

This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges completed during Week 1. Below is a brief description of each task along with the corresponding file name:

## 1. Student Grade Assignment

**File Name:** `student-grade.js`

**Description:**
This program assigns grades to students based on their total marks. It takes input for the total marks obtained by a student and assigns a grade accordingly.

## 2. Speed Detector

**File Name:** `speed-detector.js`

**Description:**
The `speed-detector.js` program determines the demerit points for a driver based on their speed. If the speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". For speeds above 70 km/h, it calculates the demerit points and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

## 3. Net Salary Calculator

**File Name:** `net-salary.js`

**Description:**
`net-salary.js` calculates various components of a net salary including gross salary, PAYEE (Pay As You Earn tax), NSSF (National Social Security Fund contribution), and NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund contribution). It takes inputs for monthly salary and benefits, and outputs the gross salary, deductions, and net salary.
