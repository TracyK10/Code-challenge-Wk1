## 2. Speed Detector

**File Name:** `speed-detector.js`

**Description:**
The `speed-detector.js` program determines the demerit points for a driver based on their speed. If the speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". For speeds above 70 km/h, it calculates the demerit points and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".
